# 000009: Performance Optimization

## Overview
Optimize the performance of memo operations, search functionality, and MCP server responses for excellent user experience.

## Goals
- Ensure fast response times for all operations
- Optimize memory usage for large memo collections
- Implement efficient caching strategies
- Minimize I/O operations where possible

## Tasks
1. Optimize memo loading and caching:
   - Implement lazy loading for memo content
   - Cache frequently accessed memos in memory
   - Use efficient data structures for memo storage
   - Implement smart cache invalidation

2. Improve search performance:
   - Build and maintain search indices
   - Use efficient string searching algorithms
   - Implement result caching for common queries
   - Optimize memory usage for large result sets

3. Optimize file system operations:
   - Batch file operations where possible
   - Use async I/O for all file operations
   - Implement parallel directory traversal
   - Cache file metadata to reduce stat() calls

4. Improve MCP server performance:
   - Optimize JSON serialization/deserialization
   - Implement connection pooling if needed
   - Use efficient data structures for protocol handling
   - Minimize memory allocations

5. Add performance monitoring:
   - Implement timing metrics for all operations
   - Add memory usage monitoring
   - Track cache hit/miss ratios
   - Log performance bottlenecks

6. Create performance benchmarks:
   - Benchmark memo operations with large datasets
   - Test search performance with various query types
   - Measure MCP server response times
   - Profile memory usage patterns

## Success Criteria
- Sub-100ms response times for common operations
- Efficient memory usage even with large memo collections
- Fast search results regardless of collection size
- Minimal startup time for MCP server
- Consistent performance under load
- Clear performance metrics and monitoring

## Implementation Notes
- Use `tokio` for async I/O operations
- Implement LRU cache for frequently accessed memos
- Use `rayon` for parallel operations where appropriate
- Profile code with `perf` or similar tools
- Use `criterion` for benchmarking
- Consider using `mmap` for large files if needed
- Test with realistic large datasets


## Proposed Solution

After analyzing the codebase, I've identified several key performance bottlenecks and will implement the following optimizations:

### Performance Bottlenecks Identified

1. **Synchronous File I/O**: All file operations in `storage.rs` use synchronous I/O (`fs::read_to_string`, `fs::write`)
2. **Inefficient Search Indexing**: Search index rebuilds completely on every dirty operation
3. **No Memo Content Caching**: All memo content is loaded from disk on every access
4. **Basic Search Implementation**: Uses simple string matching instead of proper text search algorithms
5. **Blocking Directory Traversal**: Uses `WalkDir` which blocks the async runtime
6. **Memory Inefficient Search**: Loads all memos into memory for every search operation

### Implementation Plan

#### Phase 1: Async I/O Foundation (High Priority)
- Convert all file operations in `storage.rs` to use `tokio::fs`
- Replace `WalkDir` with async directory traversal using `tokio::fs::read_dir`
- Implement async versions of memo loading and saving methods
- Add connection pooling for file operations if needed

#### Phase 2: Memo Caching System (High Priority)
- Implement LRU cache for memo content using `moka` or custom implementation
- Add lazy loading - only load memo metadata initially, content on demand
- Cache frequently accessed memos in memory with size limits
- Implement smart cache invalidation based on file modification times

#### Phase 3: Advanced Search Optimization (High Priority)
- Build inverted index using `tantivy` or custom implementation
- Implement TF-IDF scoring for better search relevance
- Cache search results for common queries
- Use streaming search results for large datasets
- Add search result pagination

#### Phase 4: File System Optimizations (High Priority)
- Implement parallel directory traversal using `rayon`
- Batch file operations where possible
- Cache file metadata to reduce `stat()` calls
- Use memory-mapped files (`memmap2`) for large memo collections

#### Phase 5: MCP Server Performance (High Priority)
- Optimize JSON serialization using `simd-json` for parsing
- Implement response streaming for large payloads
- Add request/response compression
- Use object pooling for frequently allocated structures

#### Phase 6: Performance Monitoring (Medium Priority)
- Add `tracing` spans for all performance-critical operations
- Implement metrics collection using `metrics` crate
- Track cache hit/miss ratios, response times, memory usage
- Add performance dashboards and alerts

#### Phase 7: Benchmarking Enhancements (Medium Priority)
- Extend existing criterion benchmarks with new optimizations
- Add memory usage profiling to benchmarks
- Create stress tests with realistic large datasets (10k+ memos)
- Add continuous benchmarking in CI

### Implementation Details

#### New Dependencies to Add:
```toml
# Async file I/O and utilities
tokio = { version = "1.0", features = ["full", "fs"] }

# Caching
moka = { version = "0.12", features = ["future"] }

# Advanced search (optional - can implement custom inverted index)
tantivy = "0.21"

# Parallel processing
rayon = "1.7"

# Memory mapping for large files
memmap2 = "0.9"

# SIMD JSON parsing
simd-json = "0.13"

# Metrics collection
metrics = "0.21"
```

#### Key Performance Targets:
- Sub-100ms response times for common operations (create, read, update)
- Sub-50ms search response times for collections under 10,000 memos
- Memory usage under 100MB for 10,000 cached memos
- Cache hit ratio above 80% for frequently accessed content
- Startup time under 500ms for MCP server

#### Testing Strategy:
- Use Test Driven Development for all optimizations
- Benchmark before and after each optimization phase
- Create stress tests with 50,000+ memos (using existing `stress_tests` feature)
- Profile memory usage and identify memory leaks
- Test concurrent operations under load

This approach will systematically address each performance bottleneck while maintaining backward compatibility and code quality.
