# 000007: Comprehensive Testing Suite

## Overview
Implement a thorough testing suite covering all functionality with unit tests, integration tests, and end-to-end testing.

## Goals
- Achieve high test coverage across all modules
- Test both happy path and error scenarios
- Verify MCP protocol compliance
- Ensure reliability and robustness

## Tasks
1. Create unit tests for core components:
   - `MemoStore` operations (create, read, update, delete)
   - `Memo` model validation and serialization
   - File system utilities and error handling
   - Search functionality and indexing
   - CLI argument parsing and validation

2. Implement integration tests:
   - End-to-end MCP server communication
   - File system operations with real files
   - CLI command execution and output
   - Error handling across module boundaries

3. Create MCP protocol tests:
   - Tool discovery and registration
   - Request/response handling
   - Error response formatting
   - JSON schema validation
   - Protocol compliance verification

4. Add performance tests:
   - Large memo collection handling
   - Search performance benchmarks
   - Memory usage under load
   - Concurrent operation handling

5. Implement test fixtures and utilities:
   - Mock memo collections
   - Temporary directory setup/cleanup
   - Test data generators
   - MCP client simulation

6. Create test scenarios:
   - Empty memo collection
   - Large memo collections (1000+ memos)
   - Unicode content handling
   - Malformed memo files
   - Permission errors
   - Network/IO failures

## Success Criteria
- All tests pass consistently
- High code coverage (>80%)
- Tests cover error scenarios
- Performance benchmarks meet expectations
- MCP protocol compliance verified
- CI/CD pipeline integration ready

## Implementation Notes
- Use `cargo test` for standard test execution
- Implement proper test isolation
- Use `tempfile` for temporary test directories
- Mock external dependencies appropriately
- Include property-based testing where applicable
- Document test scenarios and expected behaviors
- Use `criterion` for performance benchmarking
