# 000008: Error Handling and Logging

## Overview
Implement robust error handling and comprehensive logging throughout the application for better debugging and user experience.

## Goals
- Create consistent error handling patterns
- Implement structured logging for debugging
- Provide user-friendly error messages
- Enable proper troubleshooting capabilities

## Tasks
1. Create custom error types:
   - `MemoError` for memo-related operations
   - `StorageError` for file system operations
   - `McpError` for MCP protocol issues
   - `CliError` for command-line interface errors

2. Implement error conversion and propagation:
   - Use `anyhow` for error chaining
   - Implement `From` traits for error conversion
   - Add context to errors with meaningful messages
   - Preserve error chains for debugging

3. Add structured logging:
   - Use `tracing` for all logging throughout the app
   - Implement proper log levels (trace, debug, info, warn, error)
   - Add structured fields for searchability
   - Include request IDs for MCP operations

4. Create user-friendly error messages:
   - Clear, actionable error descriptions
   - Suggest remediation steps when possible
   - Avoid technical jargon in user-facing messages
   - Include relevant context and file paths

5. Implement logging configuration:
   - Environment variable configuration
   - Log level filtering
   - JSON output for structured logging
   - File output option for debugging

6. Add error recovery patterns:
   - Graceful degradation where possible
   - Retry mechanisms for transient failures
   - Fallback behaviors for non-critical operations
   - Clean shutdown on fatal errors

## Success Criteria
- Consistent error handling patterns throughout
- Clear, actionable error messages for users
- Comprehensive logging for debugging
- Proper error propagation and context
- Configurable logging levels and output
- No unhandled panics or crashes

## Implementation Notes
- Use `anyhow` for error handling and context
- Implement proper error boundaries
- Log all MCP operations with structured data
- Include performance metrics in logs
- Use `tracing-subscriber` for log configuration
- Test error scenarios thoroughly
- Document error codes and meanings
