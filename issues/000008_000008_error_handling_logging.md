# 000008: Error Handling and Logging

## Overview
Implement robust error handling and comprehensive logging throughout the application for better debugging and user experience.

## Goals
- Create consistent error handling patterns
- Implement structured logging for debugging
- Provide user-friendly error messages
- Enable proper troubleshooting capabilities

## Tasks
1. Create custom error types:
   - `MemoError` for memo-related operations
   - `StorageError` for file system operations
   - `McpError` for MCP protocol issues
   - `CliError` for command-line interface errors

2. Implement error conversion and propagation:
   - Use `anyhow` for error chaining
   - Implement `From` traits for error conversion
   - Add context to errors with meaningful messages
   - Preserve error chains for debugging

3. Add structured logging:
   - Use `tracing` for all logging throughout the app
   - Implement proper log levels (trace, debug, info, warn, error)
   - Add structured fields for searchability
   - Include request IDs for MCP operations

4. Create user-friendly error messages:
   - Clear, actionable error descriptions
   - Suggest remediation steps when possible
   - Avoid technical jargon in user-facing messages
   - Include relevant context and file paths

5. Implement logging configuration:
   - Environment variable configuration
   - Log level filtering
   - JSON output for structured logging
   - File output option for debugging

6. Add error recovery patterns:
   - Graceful degradation where possible
   - Retry mechanisms for transient failures
   - Fallback behaviors for non-critical operations
   - Clean shutdown on fatal errors

## Success Criteria
- Consistent error handling patterns throughout
- Clear, actionable error messages for users
- Comprehensive logging for debugging
- Proper error propagation and context
- Configurable logging levels and output
- No unhandled panics or crashes

## Implementation Notes
- Use `anyhow` for error handling and context
- Implement proper error boundaries
- Log all MCP operations with structured data
- Include performance metrics in logs
- Use `tracing-subscriber` for log configuration
- Test error scenarios thoroughly
- Document error codes and meanings


## Current State Analysis

Based on my examination of the codebase, here's what currently exists:

**Dependencies**: Already has `anyhow`, `thiserror`, `tracing`, and `tracing-subscriber` - perfect foundation!

**Current Error Handling**:
- Basic `MemorandaError` enum in `src/error.rs` with manual `Display` implementation
- `MemoStoreError` in `src/memo/storage.rs` using `thiserror` (good!)
- Inconsistent error usage - some places use `anyhow::Result`, others use custom types
- Missing error conversion between different error types
- No structured error context or recovery patterns

**Current Logging**:
- Very basic tracing initialization: `tracing_subscriber::fmt::init()`
- Basic usage of `info!`, `error!`, `warn!` macros
- No structured logging configuration or environment variable support
- No request IDs or contextual structured fields

## Proposed Solution

I'll implement a comprehensive error handling and logging system with the following approach:

### 1. Unified Error System with `thiserror`
- Refactor `MemorandaError` to use `thiserror` derive macros
- Create specific error types: `MemoError`, `StorageError`, `McpError`, `CliError`
- Implement proper `From` trait conversions between all error types
- Add contextual information to all errors

### 2. Enhanced Error Conversion and Propagation
- Use `anyhow` for error chaining and context throughout the application
- Implement error conversion patterns between different modules
- Add meaningful error context at each layer
- Preserve full error chains for debugging

### 3. Structured Logging Infrastructure
- Replace basic tracing initialization with configurable structured logging
- Add structured fields to all log messages (request_id, operation, context)
- Implement log levels throughout the application
- Add performance metrics and operation timing

### 4. User-Friendly Error Messages
- Create user-facing error messages with clear, actionable descriptions
- Include suggested remediation steps where possible
- Avoid technical jargon in user-facing messages
- Add relevant context like file paths and operation details

### 5. Logging Configuration System
- Environment variable configuration for log levels and output format
- Support for JSON structured logging output
- Optional file output for debugging
- Dynamic log level filtering

### 6. Error Recovery and Graceful Degradation
- Implement retry mechanisms for transient failures
- Add fallback behaviors for non-critical operations
- Graceful degradation when optional features fail
- Clean shutdown procedures for fatal errors

### Implementation Plan

1. **Phase 1: Core Error Types**
   - Refactor existing error types to use `thiserror`
   - Create unified error hierarchy
   - Implement proper error conversion traits

2. **Phase 2: Structured Logging**
   - Replace basic tracing initialization
   - Add structured fields throughout the application
   - Implement configurable logging

3. **Phase 3: Error Context and Recovery**
   - Add error context at all operation boundaries
   - Implement retry patterns for transient failures
   - Add graceful degradation patterns

4. **Phase 4: User Experience**
   - Create user-friendly error messages
   - Add suggested remediation steps
   - Test all error scenarios

This approach will provide:
- ✅ Consistent error handling patterns throughout the codebase
- ✅ Clear, actionable error messages for users
- ✅ Comprehensive logging for debugging and monitoring
- ✅ Proper error propagation and context preservation
- ✅ Configurable logging levels and output formats
- ✅ Error recovery patterns and graceful degradation
- ✅ No unhandled panics or crashes

The solution builds on the existing foundation and enhances it systematically without breaking existing functionality.
