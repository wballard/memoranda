# 000011: Release Preparation and Polish

## Overview
Prepare memoranda for release with final polish, packaging, and distribution setup.

## Goals
- Ensure production-ready code quality
- Set up proper release and distribution
- Add final polish and user experience improvements
- Prepare for community adoption

## Tasks
1. Final code review and cleanup:
   - Run `cargo clippy` and fix all warnings
   - Run `cargo fmt` to ensure consistent formatting
   - Review all public APIs for consistency
   - Remove any TODO comments or debug code

2. Set up release infrastructure:
   - Configure `Cargo.toml` for publication
   - Set up GitHub releases with proper versioning
   - Create release notes template
   - Set up automated release workflow

3. Add packaging and distribution:
   - Configure cross-platform builds
   - Create installation scripts
   - Set up package manager integration (homebrew, etc.)
   - Create Docker image if needed

4. Final user experience improvements:
   - Polish CLI help text and formatting
   - Add version information and build details
   - Improve error messages and suggestions
   - Add shell completion scripts

5. Create community resources:
   - Contributing guidelines
   - Code of conduct
   - Issue templates
   - Pull request templates

6. Final validation:
   - Run full test suite on multiple platforms
   - Verify MCP integration works correctly
   - Test installation and setup process
   - Validate all documentation examples

## Success Criteria
- All tests pass on target platforms
- Clean, consistent code style throughout
- Proper versioning and release setup
- Excellent user experience out of the box
