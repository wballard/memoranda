do not log info when I run the doctor command, set the log level higher

## Proposed Solution

I found two info log messages that are displayed when running the doctor command:

1. In `src/main.rs:286-290`: `info!("Running doctor command")` with verbose/auto_fix parameters
2. In `src/cli/doctor.rs:70`: `info!("Running doctor command")`

Both of these are logging at the INFO level, which is the default log level. To suppress these messages, I will change both log calls from `info!` to `debug!`. This way:

- Users running the doctor command normally will not see these internal log messages
- Users who want to see detailed logging can still access these messages by setting `MEMORANDA_LOG_LEVEL=debug` or `RUST_LOG=debug`
- The functionality remains unchanged, only the log verbosity is adjusted

Steps:
1. Change `info!` to `debug!` in `src/main.rs:286-290`  
2. Change `info!` to `debug!` in `src/cli/doctor.rs:70`
3. Test that the doctor command runs without showing these info messages
