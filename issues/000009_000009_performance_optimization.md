# 000009: Performance Optimization

## Overview
Optimize the performance of memo operations, search functionality, and MCP server responses for excellent user experience.

## Goals
- Ensure fast response times for all operations
- Optimize memory usage for large memo collections
- Implement efficient caching strategies
- Minimize I/O operations where possible

## Tasks
1. Optimize memo loading and caching:
   - Implement lazy loading for memo content
   - Cache frequently accessed memos in memory
   - Use efficient data structures for memo storage
   - Implement smart cache invalidation

2. Improve search performance:
   - Build and maintain search indices
   - Use efficient string searching algorithms
   - Implement result caching for common queries
   - Optimize memory usage for large result sets

3. Optimize file system operations:
   - Batch file operations where possible
   - Use async I/O for all file operations
   - Implement parallel directory traversal
   - Cache file metadata to reduce stat() calls

4. Improve MCP server performance:
   - Optimize JSON serialization/deserialization
   - Implement connection pooling if needed
   - Use efficient data structures for protocol handling
   - Minimize memory allocations

5. Add performance monitoring:
   - Implement timing metrics for all operations
   - Add memory usage monitoring
   - Track cache hit/miss ratios
   - Log performance bottlenecks

6. Create performance benchmarks:
   - Benchmark memo operations with large datasets
   - Test search performance with various query types
   - Measure MCP server response times
   - Profile memory usage patterns

## Success Criteria
- Sub-100ms response times for common operations
- Efficient memory usage even with large memo collections
- Fast search results regardless of collection size
- Minimal startup time for MCP server
- Consistent performance under load
- Clear performance metrics and monitoring

## Implementation Notes
- Use `tokio` for async I/O operations
- Implement LRU cache for frequently accessed memos
- Use `rayon` for parallel operations where appropriate
- Profile code with `perf` or similar tools
- Use `criterion` for benchmarking
- Consider using `mmap` for large files if needed
- Test with realistic large datasets
