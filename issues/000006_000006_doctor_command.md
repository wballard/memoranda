# 000006: Doctor Command Implementation

## Overview
Implement a comprehensive `doctor` command that diagnoses issues and provides actionable feedback to users.

## Goals
- Create thorough diagnostic checks for the memoranda system
- Provide clear, actionable feedback on issues
- Help users troubleshoot common problems
- Verify system health and configuration

## Tasks
1. Implement core diagnostic checks:
   - Verify git repository context
   - Check for `.memoranda` directory existence
   - Validate file permissions on memo directories
   - Check memo file format and validity
   - Verify MCP server dependencies

2. Create environment validation:
   - Check Rust version and toolchain
   - Verify required dependencies are available
   - Test file system permissions
   - Validate PATH and execution context

3. Implement memo validation:
   - Check memo file encoding (UTF-8)

   - Actionable remediation steps
   - Summary of system health

6. Implement fix suggestions:
   - Automatic fixes for common issues
   - Step-by-step manual fix instructions
   - Links to documentation when relevant
   - Command examples for fixes

## Success Criteria
- Comprehensive system health checks
- Clear problem identification and reporting
- Actionable remediation suggestions
