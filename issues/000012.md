Rename the `server` command to `serve`.

Update the readme.

## Proposed Solution

After analyzing the codebase, I found that this issue has already been completed. The command was already renamed from `server` to `serve` during the implementation of issue 000003 (Basic CLI Interface).

### Current State Verification

1. **CLI Command Structure** (`src/main.rs:32`): The command is defined as `Serve` in the Commands enum
2. **Help System** (`src/main.rs:194-203`): The help function is `print_serve_help()` 
3. **Completion Files**: Both Fish and Zsh completion files reference `serve` not `server`
4. **Documentation**: All README and documentation files reference the `serve` command
5. **Testing**: Running `memoranda serve --help` works correctly
6. **Verification**: Running `memoranda server --help` shows "unrecognized subcommand 'server'" with a helpful tip suggesting 'serve'

### Evidence of Prior Completion

The renaming was completed as part of issue 000003, as documented in the completed issue file:
- Line 92 in `issues/complete/000003_000003_basic_cli_interface.md` specifically mentions: "Rename `Server` command to `Serve` to match the issue specification"

### Status

This issue is already **COMPLETED**. No further changes are needed to the codebase.

The README already correctly documents the `serve` command, so no updates are required there either.
